# A Chess Question

## Welcome!

This is a Python program that answers a simple question:  
**Given a board state that the user enters (with 1 white figure and up to 16 black figures), which black figures can the white figure capture?**

---

## üìñ Program Description

1. The program first prompts the user to input a white chess piece and its position on the board.  
   - The user must choose between two predefined piece types: **pawn** or **rook**.
   - The input format must be: (e.g., `pawn a5` or `rook d4`).
   - The program will confirm a successful addition or display an error message if the input is invalid.

2. After the white piece is set, the user is asked to enter the black pieces, one by one, in the same format.  
   - The user must add at least **one** black piece and can add up to **sixteen**.
   - After adding at least one black piece, the user can type **`done`** to stop adding pieces.
   - The program will confirm each successful addition or display an error message for invalid input.

3. The program will validate all inputs:
   - Coordinates must follow the correct format: a letter `a-h` followed by a number `1-8` (e.g., `a1`, `d4`, `h8`).
   - The piece names must be valid (`pawn`, `rook` for the white piece; standard chess pieces for black pieces).
   - Pieces cannot overlap; each square can be occupied by only one piece.
   - Users cannot enter "done" before adding at least one black piece.

4. After all pieces are added, the program will:
   - Display a list of black pieces that the white piece can capture based on **standard chess moves** (e.g., pawns capture diagonally, rooks move horizontally/vertically).
   - If no black pieces can be captured, the program will indicate this clearly.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.10** or higher (tested with Python **3.13**)

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the program with:

```bash
python chessgame.py
```

### üí° Example Usage

```bash
Enter the white piece (pawn/rook) and its position: pawn d4
White piece added: pawn at d4

Enter a black piece and its position: pawn c5
Black piece added: pawn at c5

Enter a black piece and its position: queen d6
Black piece added: queen at d6

Enter a black piece and its position: done

Capturable black pieces:
- pawn at c5
```
